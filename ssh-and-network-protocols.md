# Question
what does ssh mean in computing

# Answer
SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a network protocol used for secure remote access and secure data communication
over an unsecured network. SSH allows a user to securely connect to a remote computer or server over a network
and execute commands or transfer files between the local and remote systems.

When you use SSH to connect to a remote server or computer, all data transmitted between the local and remote
system is encrypted, which helps prevent unauthorized access or interception of sensitive data.

SSH is commonly used by system administrators, developers, and other technical users for remote management
and secure file transfer between computers or servers.

# Question
what are network protocols
# Answer
In computing, a network protocol is a set of rules and procedures used to govern communication between devices
in a computer network. Network protocols define the format and sequence of messages that are exchanged between
network devices, as well as the actions that should be taken by each device in response to those messages.

Network protocols can be categorized into different layers based on their functionality. The most commonly 
referenced networking protocol suite is the OSI model, which has seven layers: physical, data link, network, 
transport, session, presentation, and application. Each layer has its own set of protocols that handle specific
tasks and functions.

Some common network protocols include:

- Internet Protocol (IP): Provides the addressing and routing information necessary to deliver data packets
 between devices on a network.
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Provides reliable, ordered delivery of data packets between devices 
by establishing a connection and confirming data transfer.
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Provides a simpler, connectionless alternative to TCP for applications that
 don't require reliable, ordered data transfer.
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Used for transferring data over the World Wide Web, including web pages,
 images, and other media.
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Used for sending and receiving email messages over a network.

By adhering to agreed-upon network protocols, devices on a network can communicate with each other reliably
and efficiently, regardless of differences in hardware or software.

# Question
what are the basic components in a computer network

# Answer
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources. The basic
components of a computer network include:

- Devices: The devices in a computer network are the computers, servers, printers, routers, switches, 
hubs, and other devices that are connected to the network.

- Network Interface: Each device on a network has a network interface, which is a piece of hardware or 
software that allows the device to communicate with other devices on the network.

- Transmission Media: The transmission media refers to the physical means by which data is transmitted 
between devices in a network. This can include wired media such as Ethernet cables or fiber optic cables, 
or wireless media such as Wi-Fi or cellular networks.

- Network protocols: Network protocols are a set of rules and procedures that govern communication 
between devices on a network. They ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely between devices 
on the network.

- Network Services: Network services are the applications and services that are provided by a network, 
such as email, file sharing, printing, and internet access.

- Network topology: Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. There are 
different network topologies, such as bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree topologies, each with its own advantages 
and disadvantages.

These components work together to allow devices on a network to communicate and share resources. By using 
these components, a computer network can provide efficient and reliable communication and data sharing 
for individuals and organizations.
